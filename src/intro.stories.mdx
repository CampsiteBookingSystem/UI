# OwlNite UI

OwlNite UI is a React component library used for our front-end applications.
This library will be continuously updated when we add new components to our applications.

## Installation

At the moment, the library is only available through Github while we develop the library.

- Install the dependency with `npm` :

```bash
npm install @owlnite/ui
```

### Use

Import components you want into your UI

```jsx
import { Button } from '@owlnite/ui';
```

You can find individual documentation about how to use each component in the **Components** folder.

## Development & Playground

To execute changes or add new components, you need to locally install the library.

- Clone the repository from Github

```bash
git clone git@github.com:owlnite/ui.git
```

- Install the dependencies

```bash
cd ui
npm install
```

- Start the development server

```bash
npm start storybook
```

This Storybook has a playground where you can play with the different components and try out the different properties.
Once the development server is started, you can find it at http://localhost:3300
