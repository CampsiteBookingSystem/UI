# Booking System UI

Booking System UI is a React component library used for our front-end applications.
This library will be continuously updated when we add new components to our applications.

## Installation

At the moment, the library is only available through Github while we develop the library.

- Install the dependency with `yarn` or `npm` :

```bash
yarn add git+ssh://git@github.com:CampsiteBookingSystem/UI.git#X.Y.Z
```

_`X.Y.Z` stands for the version of the library to install. The latest version can be found [here](https://github.com/CampsiteBookingSystem/UI/releases). We recommend installing a specific version as this library might change regularly._

### Use

Import components you want into your UI

```jsx
import { Button } from 'booking-system-ui';
```

You can find individual documentation about how to use each component in the **Components** folder.

### Update

To update the library, just install the latest version.

```bash
yarn add git+ssh://git@github.com/CampsiteBookingSystem/UI.git#X.Y.Z
```

## Development & Playground

To execute changes or add new components, you need to locally install the library.

- Clone the repository from Github

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CampsiteBookingSystem/UI.git
```

- Install the dependencies

```bash
cd UI
yarn
```

- Start the development server

```bash
yarn storybook
```

This Storybook has a playground where you can play with the different components and try out the different properties.
Once the development server is started, you can find it at http://localhost:3300
