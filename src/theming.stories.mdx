# Theming

This library has been built with theming in mind as we might distribute modified version to our different partners.

Theming is very easy, all changeable options are defined with CSS variables, the only thing you need to do is overwrite those variables.

## Colors

Here are the variables used in the application together with their default values.

If you want to include the default colors into your application, and afterwards overwrite some of them, you can include this file:

```jsx
import 'booking-system-ui/lib/styles/colors.css';
```

<Container>
  <Row>
    {Object.keys(colors).map(key => (
      <Column key={key} amount={3}>
        <Color default={colors[key]} name={key} />
      </Column>
    ))}
  </Row>
</Container>

## Fonts

If you want to include the default fonts into your application, import the following file:

```jsx
import 'booking-system-ui/lib/styles/fonts/open-sans.css';
```

These are the fonts included with the file:

<Container>
  <Row>
    <Column amount={1}>
      <Font name="Open Sans" />
    </Column>
  </Row>
</Container>
